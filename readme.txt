This plugin lets you tell Google News about your excellent new post or give credit to other sites' great posts. 

== Description ==

This plugin works with [Google's September 2011 announcement of the standout tag](http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/recognizing-publishers-standout-content.html "Standout Stories") to help news sites inform Google about their best content.

The plugin has two separate actions:

1. Label your own current story a Standout. This is done on the right rail with a click. This will add a link in your post's header that's invisible to your readers but visible to web spiders. Since Google advises sites not to use this more than 7 times a week, the plugin keeps a running tally and tells you how many you have left.   

1. Give other's credit when it's due. If you are re-blogging or referencing a great post from another publication, you can signal this to Google News and win yourself some Karma. This can be done as often as you like. To add this link, simply use the black and red S button on the Visual Editor when you want to link to that other story in the body of your post. When you publish your post, the plugin will add a link in your post's header that Google News can use.         

The plugin is the work of [Contextly](http://contextly.com "Contextly"), a related links service and more for sites that care about their content. Currently Contextly is an invite-only beta, but if you are interested, please sign up on our site or e-mail us at info@contextly.com.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

When you select one of your posts as a standout story, the plugin puts a special link in the header of the story, which your readers won't see, but Google News will. If you re-blog or reference a great story someone else wrote, you can use the special standout link button on the Visual Editor bar to give them credit. The links in your post's header look like this: `<link rel='standout' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/business/luck-is-just-the-spark-for-business-giants.html' />`

= What will Google News do with the links? =

Google says it will use the standout story links as part of its determination of which stories to feature on its popular news page. 

= So this is Google only? What about Yahoo News? =  

The tags are visible to any search spider so if it's a useful signal, expect other aggregation sites will use it as well.
